# Web_RTC_Live_Support_Addon
A Real Time Communications Live Support Chat add-on that is Easy to implement with any Website. It uses Google WebRTC data channeling packaged into the EasyRTC framework to host a Node.JS SSL Server that handles signaling between the active Administrator &amp; Users! With a HTML5, CSS &amp; JS frontend.

# Notes:
In the event that the provided "easyrtc-server.zip" Node.JS Server-Side signaling SSL server fails to work I recommend visiting www.easyrtc.com to download the latest update and check out the demos to see what has changed for the frontend, or just update to the latest SSL Server it provides for updated TURN, STUN and ICE servers because these would likely be why it may not work with my shared version.
This Node.JS can be hosted in your Web server on an alternative port as long as your hosting has Node.JS or your able to install Node.JS. Alternatively it can be hosted from any Windows or Linux VPS, etc with Node.JS installed.

The LiveSupport folder contains everything needed to be stored on the Web Hosting server in a sub folder, and then simply load the Users Chat support in a side screen pop up or something similar to allow communication with an Admin. Its not pretty so improve the look!

This report contains a full indepth look at the technologies used here, the problems, solutions and impact!
It also provides a detailed step by step guide on how to use this Live Chat Support, install things, and get it all working in a localhost environment for testing purposes! I highly recommend reading my Report is interested in this project, or just interested the Google WebRTC, EasyRTC or Node.JS Technologies.
